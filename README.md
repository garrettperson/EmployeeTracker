# Employee Tracker

  ## Description
  My motivation in creating this project was to create an easy-to-navigate application that accesses databases to display information about a company's employees. I built this project to solve the problem of needing to keep track of each employee and their role in the company. I learned a lot about SQL and how it interacts with JavaScript.
